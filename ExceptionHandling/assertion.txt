Here is the **explanation of the slide in clear, simple, interview-ready language**, plus a **tiny example showing how NDEBUG disables assertions**.

---

# ✅ **Assertions — Turning Them Off Using `NDEBUG`**

Assertions (`assert(condition)`) are meant **only for debugging**, not for production.
C++ provides a mechanism to **disable all assertions** in the program using:

```cpp
#define NDEBUG
```

This macro must appear **before** including `<cassert>` (or `<assert.h>`).

### ✔ When `NDEBUG` is defined:

* All `assert()` checks are **removed by the compiler**.
* No condition is checked at runtime.
* The program **never stops**, even if assertions fail.

### ✔ When `NDEBUG` is *not* defined:

* `assert()` statements are active.
* Failed assertions print an error message and terminate the program.

This allows developers to have **strict error checking in debug builds**, while **removing runtime overhead** in release builds.

# 🧪 **Example Showing How Assertions Are Disabled**

### ✅ Debug Build (Assertions ON)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = -5;
    assert(x > 0);  // ❌ This will FAIL in debug mode
    cout << "Program continues…" << endl;
}
```

### Output:

```
Assertion failed: x > 0, file main.cpp, line 6
```

---

### 🚀 Release Build (Assertions OFF)

```cpp
#define NDEBUG     // Disable all assert() checks
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = -5;
    assert(x > 0);  // ❌ This line does NOTHING now
    cout << "Program continues…" << endl; // Program runs normally
}
```

### Output:

```
Program continues…
```

# 🎯 **Typical Uses of Assertions**

Assertions are used for **internal sanity checks**, such as:

* validating parameters inside functions:

  ```cpp
  assert(size > 0);
  ```
* verifying array bounds (in debug mode)
* checking invariants in classes
* ensuring preconditions/postconditions in algorithms
