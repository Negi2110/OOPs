Great question — and the answer is **YES and NO**, depending on the type of data member.

Let me explain it clearly.

---

# ✅ **1. For NORMAL (non-static) data members**

You **cannot** assign a value to them directly inside the class body.

❌ Not allowed:

```cpp
class A {
    int x = 10;   // (Before C++11 this was illegal; now allowed but only for simple initialization)
};
```

Before C++11, this caused an error.

After C++11, this is called **in-class member initialization** and is allowed **ONLY for fundamental types or values**.

BUT the traditional, correct way is:

✔ Allowed:

```cpp
class A {
    int x;
public:
    A() { x = 10; }     // Initialize inside constructor
};
```

### **BUT WHY is constructor preferred?**

Because:

* It gives flexibility
* It allows dynamic initialization
* It avoids repeated initializations
* It works with all compilers and all versions of C++

# ✅ **2. For STATIC data members**

You **cannot initialize them inside the class**.

❌ Not allowed:

```cpp
class Player {
    static int count = 0;   // ❌ ERROR
};
```

✔ Must be done **outside** the class:

```cpp
int Player::count = 0;    // Correct
```

Why?

Because static members belong to the **class**, not objects.
So they need separate global storage, not object storage.

---

# ✅ **3. For const static integral members**

These *can* be initialized inside the class:

✔ Allowed:

```cpp
class A {
    static const int size = 10;   // allowed
};
```

---

# ✅ **4. Pointer or dynamic memory**

You **cannot** initialize them inside the class directly.

❌ Not allowed:

```cpp
class A {
    int* p = new int(5);    // ❌ Bad practice in class body
};
```

✔ Must be in constructor:

```cpp
A() { p = new int(5); }
```

# 🎯 **Final Summary (Copy-Paste for Interview)**

| Type of Data Member      | Can it be initialized inside class?  | Correct Place       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Normal variable          | ✔ (C++11+) but constructor preferred | Constructor         |
| Static variable          | ❌ No                                 | Outside class       |
| const static int         | ✔ Yes                                | Inside class        |
| Pointer / dynamic memory | ❌ No                                 | Constructor         |
| Reference                | ❌ No                                 | Initialization list |

# 🧠 Answer to Your Question:

> “In class we can't set the value of data member only inside constructor we can do this??”

✔ **Correct for static members → cannot set inside class**
✔ **Correct for pointer/dynamic members → use constructor**
✔ **Normal members → can set in class (C++11+) but constructor is preferred**
