Here are **clean, crisp, interview-ready notes** based exactly on your slide **Copy Constructors**:

# ✅ **Copy Constructors – Interview Notes**

### **1. What is a Copy Constructor?**

A **copy constructor** is a special constructor used to initialize a new object from an existing object of the same class.

Syntax:

```cpp
ClassName(const ClassName& identifier);
```

* Takes **one parameter** → a **reference** to an object of the same class.
* Usually marked **const** so the original object cannot be modified.

---

### **2. Why Do We Use Copy Constructors?**

Because when you create a new object as a copy of another, the compiler needs to know **how to copy** the class members.

Example:

```cpp
MyClass a;
MyClass b = a;   // copy constructor is invoked
```

---

### **3. Default vs User-Defined Copy Constructor**

#### **🔸 Default (Compiler-Generated) Copy Constructor**

* Created automatically when you do not define your own.
* Performs a **shallow copy** (member-wise copy).
* Copies pointers **as addresses**, causing both objects to share memory.
* Dangerous for classes that manage dynamic memory.

#### **🔸 User-Defined Copy Constructor**

* Overrides default behavior.
* Needed when your class has:

  * Pointers
  * Dynamic memory (`new`)
  * Resources (files, sockets)
* Allows you to implement a **deep copy**.

---

### **4. When is the Copy Constructor Invoked?**

Copy constructor is automatically called when:

1. **Object is initialized from another object**

   ```cpp
   MyClass b = a;
   ```
2. **Object is passed by value** to a function
3. **Object is returned by value** from a function
4. When elements are **initialized in arrays** or **containers**
5. When using **initializer lists**

---

### **5. Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy**

* **Shallow copy** → default behavior, pointer addresses copied, shared memory.
* **Deep copy** → allocate new memory & copy values → both objects independent.

---

### **6. Why the parameter is passed as `const ClassName&`?**

* Using **reference (&)** avoids creating a copy → prevents infinite recursion.
* Using **const** prevents modifying the original object during copying.

---

# 📌 **Copy-Paste Interview Summary**

* A copy constructor initializes a new object from an existing one.
* Syntax: `ClassName(const ClassName&)`.
* Called during initialization, pass-by-value, return-by-value.
* Default copy constructor creates a **shallow copy**.
* User-defined copy constructor is needed for **deep copy**.
* Shallow copies share memory → dangerous when using pointers.
* Deep copies allocate separate memory and safely copy data.

“The copy constructor must take a reference because pass-by-value requires copying the argument,
 which would invoke the copy constructor again and again, causing infinite recursion and stack overflow.”
