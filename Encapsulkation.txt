Here is a clean, crisp **interview-ready explanation** of **Encapsulation in C++**, covering **all points from the slide** but rewritten professionally.

# ✅ **Encapsulation — Interview Answer (Perfect Version)**

**Encapsulation** is one of the core principles of OOP. It refers to **wrapping data (variables) and functions (methods) into a single unit**—the class—and **restricting direct access** to the internal state of an object.

### **1. Member variables define the object’s state**

Every object maintains its own internal state through **member variables**.
Encapsulation helps protect this state from unintended modifications.

### **2. Why we avoid direct access to variables**

If we allow direct access to member variables:

* It can create **inconsistencies** in the object's state
* It leads to **tight coupling** between the class and the external code using it
* Any change in variable naming or validation rules may break code everywhere

So, giving direct access to the internal state is considered bad design.

### **3. Good practice: Keep data private**

The best practice is:

* **Make data members private**
* Provide **public getter and setter methods** to control access

This ensures:

* Validation before modification
* Controlled read/write access
* Loose coupling
* Better maintainability

### **4. Two types of member functions**

Encapsulation introduces two categories of methods:

#### **A. Mutators (Setters)**

* Modify or update the object’s internal state
* Default behavior of regular methods
  Example:

```cpp
void setAge(int age) { this->age = age; }
```

#### **B. Accessors (Getters)**

* Provide read-only access
* **Do not modify** the internal state of the object
* Declared using the `const` keyword

Example:

```cpp
int getAge() const { return age; }
```

### **5. `const` makes a function an accessor**

Appending `const` to a member function guarantees:

* The function **cannot modify any member variables**
* The function becomes a **read-only accessor**

Syntax:

```cpp
type functionName() const { }
```

# 🎯 **Final Interview-Ready Summary**

**Encapsulation** means hiding the internal state of an object and exposing it only through controlled interfaces.
We achieve this by making data members **private**, and providing:

* **Mutators (setters)** to modify the state
* **Accessors (getters)** to read the state, often marked as **const**

This avoids tight coupling, improves data integrity, and ensures the object maintains a valid and consistent state.
