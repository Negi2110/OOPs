Below is the **Auto Pointer example explained with code**, where the **comments are written from an interview perspective and side notes**, exactly matching what interviewers look for 👇

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>   // Interview point: auto_ptr is defined here
using namespace std;

/*
 INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
 This class is used to demonstrate constructor and destructor calls.
 The output helps prove automatic memory management.
*/
class GameObject {
public:
    // Constructor
    GameObject() {
        cout << "Constructor Invoked" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~GameObject() {
        cout << "Destructor Invoked" << endl;
    }
};

/*
 INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
 This function creates an object using auto_ptr.
 The object is automatically destroyed when the auto_ptr
 goes out of scope.
*/
void f() {

    /*
     INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
     auto_ptr takes ownership of the dynamically allocated object.
     No need to explicitly call delete.
    */
    auto_ptr<GameObject> obj(new GameObject());

    /*
     SIDE NOTE (IMPORTANT):
     When this function ends, obj goes out of scope,
     so the destructor of GameObject is called automatically.
    */
}

int main() {

    /*
     INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
     Calling function f().
     Memory is allocated inside f() and cleaned up automatically.
    */
    f();

    return 0;
}
```

## 🧠 What Interviewers Expect You to Explain (Side Explanation)

* `auto_ptr` is a **smart pointer** provided by early C++ standards
* It automatically deletes the object it owns when it goes out of scope
* This prevents **memory leaks**
* Ownership of the object belongs to **only one auto_ptr**

---

## ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW NOTE

> **`auto_ptr` is deprecated in C++11 and removed in C++17**

### Why interviewers still ask about it:

* To test understanding of **ownership semantics**
* To see if you know **modern replacements**

---

## ✅ Modern Replacement (Mention in Interview)

* `unique_ptr` → exclusive ownership (replacement for `auto_ptr`)
* `shared_ptr` → shared ownership

**Strong interview answer line:**

> *“`auto_ptr` provides automatic memory management using RAII, but it is deprecated due to unsafe ownership transfer semantics and has been replaced by `unique_ptr`.”*
