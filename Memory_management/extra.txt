## 📌 Interview-Perspective Explanation (Theory)

In the given example, `obj` is a **local pointer** that points to memory allocated dynamically using `new`. Normally, when we use a raw pointer, the destructor of the object is called **only if we explicitly use `delete`**. If `delete` is forgotten, the dynamically allocated memory remains in use, causing a **memory leak**. However, when `obj` is an `auto_ptr`, it follows the **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** principle. This means the `auto_ptr` takes ownership of the dynamically allocated object and **automatically deletes it when the pointer goes out of scope**. As a result, the destructor of the object is invoked automatically without the programmer needing to write an explicit `delete` statement.

## 🧠 Key Interview Points (Side Notes)

* With **raw pointers**, memory must be freed manually using `delete`
* Forgetting `delete` leads to **memory leaks**
* `auto_ptr` performs **automatic cleanup**
* Destructor is called when `auto_ptr` goes out of scope
* `auto_ptr` is deprecated, but the concept leads to `unique_ptr`

## 💻 Code Example with Interview Comments

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>   // Required for auto_ptr (legacy)
using namespace std;

/*
 INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
 This class is used to observe constructor and destructor calls.
*/
class GameObject {
public:
    GameObject() {
        cout << "Constructor Invoked" << endl;
    }

    ~GameObject() {
        cout << "Destructor Invoked" << endl;
    }
};

void f() {

    /*
     INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
     obj is a local auto_ptr managing a dynamically allocated object.
     Normally, without auto_ptr, we would need an explicit delete.
    */
    auto_ptr<GameObject> obj(new GameObject());

    /*
     SIDE NOTE:
     No delete statement is written here.
     auto_ptr will automatically delete the object
     when obj goes out of scope.
    */
}

int main() {

    /*
     INTERVIEW PERSPECTIVE:
     When f() finishes execution, obj goes out of scope,
     so the destructor of GameObject is called automatically.
    */
    f();

    return 0;
}
```
