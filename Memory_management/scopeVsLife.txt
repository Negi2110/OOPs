## What does **scope** mean here?

**Scope** refers to **where in the program a variable is accessible (visible and usable)**.

In simple terms:

> **Scope = where you are allowed to use the variable in code**

## Scope vs Lifetime (VERY IMPORTANT)

Interviewers often test this distinction:

| Term         | Meaning                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**    | *Where* the variable can be accessed in the code |
| **Lifetime** | *How long* the variable exists in memory         |

They are related but **not the same**.

## Scope in the context of the STACK

When we say:

> “Memory allocated on the stack stays in scope as long as it is on the stack”

We mean:

* A **local (stack) variable**

  * Is **accessible only inside the block/function** where it is declared
  * Stops being accessible once execution leaves that block

---

## Example 1: Function scope (most common)

```c
void foo() {
    int x = 10;   // x is in scope here
    printf("%d", x);
}                // x goes out of scope here
```

* **Scope of `x`** → inside `foo()`
* **Lifetime of `x`** → from function entry to function exit
* After `foo()` returns:

  * `x` is **out of scope**
  * Stack memory for `x` is **destroyed**

---

## Example 2: Block scope

```c
void bar() {
    if (true) {
        int y = 5;   // y is in scope here
    }               // y goes out of scope here
}
```

* **Scope of `y`** → inside the `if` block
* Stack memory is freed when the block ends

---

## Example 3: Scope vs lifetime trick question

```c
int* bad() {
    int x = 10;
    return &x;   // ❌
}
```

* `x` is:

  * **In scope** only inside `bad()`
  * **Destroyed** when `bad()` returns
* Returning its address gives a **dangling pointer**
* Classic interview pitfall 🚩

---

## Compare with GLOBAL / STATIC variables

```c
int g = 10;   // global variable
```

* **Scope** → entire file (or program)
* **Lifetime** → entire program
* Stored in **global/data segment**, not stack

```c
void foo() {
    static int s = 0;
}
```

* **Scope** → inside `foo()` only
* **Lifetime** → entire program
* Stored in **data segment**, not stack

## One-line interview answer (use this!)

> **Scope means the region of the program where a variable is accessible.
> For stack variables, scope is limited to the function or block, and once execution leaves that scope, the variable becomes inaccessible and its stack memory is reclaimed.**
