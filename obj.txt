Here are **clean, copy-paste–ready notes** based on your slide about **Initializing Data Members**:

## **Initializing Data Members – Notes**

* Unlike global variables, **class data members are NOT automatically initialized** with default values.
* If a data member is not explicitly initialized, its value is **undefined** (contains garbage).
* **Data members cannot be initialized at the point of declaration** inside the class (except `static const` members).

---

### ❌ **Invalid example (will NOT compile)**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int id = 1;   // ❌ Not allowed (except static const)
};
```

Only **static const** data members can be initialized inside the class.

---

## **Correct way: Initialize inside the constructor**

### ✔ Valid example

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int id;

    MyClass() {
        id = 1;   // ✔ Correct way
    }
};
```

This is the normal practice:
👉 Initialize member variables inside the **constructor**.

---

## **Copy-Paste Summary**

* Class members are **not auto-initialized** like global variables.
* Uninitialized data members contain **garbage values**.
* You **cannot initialize** normal data members where they are defined.
* Only `static const` members may be initialized inside the class.
* Best practice: **initialize data members inside the constructor**.

If you want, I can combine all constructor-related slides into a single polished PDF for study.



Here are **clean, copy-paste–ready notes** based exactly on your slide about **Member Initialisers**:

---

## **Member Initialiser – Notes**

* A **member initializer list** is a shorthand way to assign values to data members.
* Works **as if each data member had its own constructor**.
* Used immediately after the constructor’s parameter list, starting with a **colon (`:`)**.
* Multiple members are separated by **commas**.
* **Must be written in the constructor’s definition only**, not in the declaration (header).

---

### **Syntax**

```cpp
ClassName(type param1, type param2) 
    : memVar1(param1), memVar2(param2) 
{
}
```

---

### **Example**

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int value;

public:
    MyClass(int theValue) 
        : value(theValue)    // member initializer list
    {
    }
};
```

---

## **Copy-Paste Summary**

* Member initializer lists provide a **clean and efficient method** to initialize member variables.
* Syntax appears **after the constructor parameters** with a colon.
* Recommended for:

  * Initializing data members
  * Initializing const variables
  * Initializing reference members
  * Initializing base classes
* Only allowed in the **constructor definition**, not the declaration.
