Here are **clean, crisp, interview-ready notes** based exactly on your slide **C++ References**:

# ✅ **C++ References – Interview Notes**

### **1. What is a reference?**

* A reference is an **alias for an existing variable**.
* It does **not** create a new variable; it becomes another name for the original one.

---

### **2. How does it behave?**

* Changing the value through the reference **changes the original variable**.
* Both the reference and the original variable refer to **the same memory location**.

---

### **3. Common use cases**

* Mainly used to **pass objects or variables to functions** without creating a copy.
* Very useful when a function needs to **modify the argument** passed to it.

---

### **4. Syntax**

* A reference type uses **&** after the type:

  ```cpp
  int x = 10;
  int &ref = x;
  ```

---

### **5. Initialization Rules**

* A reference **must be initialized at the moment it is declared**.
* References **cannot** be initialized to `NULL` or `0`.
* Except for function parameters and return types, you **must bind it immediately**.

---

### **6. Reference cannot be reseated**

* Once a reference is bound to a variable, it **cannot refer to another variable**.
* However, the **value** of the referenced variable **can change**.

---

# 📌 **Simple Example for Interview**

```cpp
int x = 10;
int &ref = x;   // ref is an alias for x

ref = 20;       // changes x as well
cout << x;      // prints 20
```

---

# 🧠 **Quick Interview Summary**

* A reference is an **alias**, not a pointer.
* Must be **initialized immediately**.
* Cannot be changed to reference another variable.
* Used for **pass-by-reference** to avoid copying and allow modifications.
* Uses **&** in the type, not in the usage.

If you want, I can prepare **pointer vs reference** comparison (very common interview question).
